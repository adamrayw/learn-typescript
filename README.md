# TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft which is a derivative of the JavaScript programming language. TypeScript adds static data type features and various other high-level features to JavaScript. This is useful to help find and fix errors at the development stage, so you can avoid problems that may occur while your application is running.
